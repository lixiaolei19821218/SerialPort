  ADM4100W The db2ckupgrade or UPGRADE DATABASE command identified external routines or user-defined wrappers that could have potential incompatibility with the multi-threaded database manager. See the file %1 that contains the list of routines and wrappers identified, or a set of statements to restore the routines or wrappers definition altered by the UPGRADE DATABASE command. 
  An error occurred while opening the file: '%1' for write.
  An error occurred writing to the '%1' file.
  Beginning in DB2 Version 9.5, the database manager is now multi-threaded on UNIX and Linux platforms. To prevent potential problems that can occur due to the execution of thread unsafe code, all external NOT FENCED routines will be altered to FENCED and NOT THREADSAFE during database upgrade. The following is a list of all the affected routines in database '%1'. Once the routines are confirmed to be thread-safe, they can be altered back to NOT FENCED.
  An error occurred while binding '%1' to database.
  An error occurred while getting the routine's library name from '%1'. 
  An error occurred while checking the library dependency of the routine: '%1'
  An error occurred while setting the bypass flag for Query Patroller. SQLCODE = "%1".
  The db2ckupgrade command must be issued on the downlevel instance prior to upgrading the instance. 
  SQL1498W There are tables in the database that contain one or more type-1 indexes. To convert them to type-2 indexes, run the %1 CLP script prior to database upgrade.
  SQL0553N An object cannot be created with the schema name "%1".
  ADM4103W The connection attribute %1 contains asterisks (*) in the workload %2. A single asterisk (*) will be replaced with two asterisks (**) during database upgrade. Reason code = %3. 
  ADM4102W The database contains one or more identifiers named NULL. To avoid conflict with the NULL keyword, you should qualify or delimit with double quotes any identifiers named NULL in SQL statements.
  ADM4104E One or more databases are enabled for XML Extender. You must remove the XML Extender functionality from the instance and databases before upgrading. Please refer to the DB2 Information Center for details on the steps to upgrade XML Extender including how to disable XML Extender in databases.
  ADM4105W The Database is enabled for DB2 WebSphere MQ functions. The set of functions defined for XML Extender will be dropped during database upgrade.
  SQL1032N No start database manager command was issued.  SQLSTATE=57019
  The database has one or more tables in load pending state.
  The database has one or more tables in redistribute pending state.
